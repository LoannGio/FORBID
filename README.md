# FORBID: Fast Overlap Removal By Stochastic Gradient Descent for Graph Drawing

This repository was built to share the source code of the FORBID algorithm and provide some indication and code to compile, run and visualize it.

It contains the source code of the algorithm in ``./src``. Some code was bothered from the S_GDÂ² algorithm that FORBID leverages (https://github.com/jxz12/s_gd2).

A demo file and some python code to visualize it are also shared in ``./demo``.
